## Download and Install :dizzy:

Installation is available as a Flatpak.

<a href='https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.taiko2k.tauonmb'><img width='240' alt='Download on Flathub' src='https://flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.png'/></a>

Flatpak uses sandboxing, see [here](https://github.com/Taiko2k/TauonMusicBox/wiki/Sandboxing-Quirks) for notes. While the Flatpak version is recommended, you can also install from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tauon-music-box/) on **Arch Linux** based distros.
