# A script for the lazy folk and probably a butchering of git.
# Run this script once you have **ALL OF THE DEPENDENCIES** set up and
# updated; this also include dependencies **OUTSIDE OF PYTHON**, like
# 'opusfile-devel' on Fedora.
# Either way, the debug message pointing out what is missing when
# compiling PHAzOR (line #16) helps you find out what is needed.
# Those packages usually have similar enough names to be found quite
# easily by your package manager of choice.
#
# The script below installs the TauonMusicBox repo as a desktop app by
# cloning files into temporary ones and changing+deploying them;
# lines #38 to #43. I did it because I was too lazy to learn RPM
# packaging :B
#
# If you're running it for the very first time
# (and just to be on the safe side), then the repository itself should
# probably be cleansed, as in:
#   ----------------------------------
#   git reset --hard && git clean -dfx
#   ----------------------------------
#
# NEVER run this script as sudo!
# Thank you.
