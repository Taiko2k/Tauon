# Contributing to Tauon Music Box

Wanna contribute? Theres a few ways you can:

### Issues

If you encounter an issue, feel free to create new issues on github.

For crashes, it would be most helpful if you could replicate the crash and capture the error from terminal output.

  - To run manually for AUR install: `tauon`
  - Or for Flatpak: `flatpak run com.github.taiko2k.tauonmb`

For suggestions, I may or may not choose to implement certain things. Explaining how a feature would be integrated would be more helpful than vague ideas.
Design concepts would be interesting to see, but you should check with me before investing too much time into it.

### Translations

[See here](https://github.com/Taiko2k/TauonMusicBox/wiki/Translations)

### Code Contributions

The code base for core and UI related elements is very (very) messy, and there are strict design requiements, as such I don't expect code contributions for these things.

Tauon's submodules are more manageable to work on. GStreamer familiarity would be helpful.

### Other

Other areas for contribution could include website design, promotion and documentation.
