# Contributing to Tauon Music Box

Wanna contribute? Theres a few ways you can:

## Issues

If you encounter an issue, feel free to create new issues on github.

#### Possibly helpful information to include:

 - What method did you use to install Tauon? 
    - Flatpak? Snap? AUR? Other/Manual?
 - What version number is shown under MENU > Settings... > About
 - For audio/transition related issues, what backend do you have selected under MENU > Settings... > About. Does the issue happen on both backends? Are you playing local files, or files from a particuar network server?
 - For crashes, it would be most helpful if you could replicate the crash and capture the error from terminal output.
    - To run manually for AUR install: `tauon`. For Flatpak: `flatpak run com.github.taiko2k.tauonmb`

For suggestions, I may or may not choose to implement certain things. Explaining how a feature would be integrated would be more helpful than vague ideas.
Design concepts would be interesting to see, but you should check with me before investing too much time into it.

## Code Contributions

The code base for core and UI related elements is very (very) messy, and there are strict design requiements, as such I don't expect code contributions for these things.

Tauon's submodules are more manageable to work on.

## Other

Other areas for contribution could include website design, promotion and documentation.
