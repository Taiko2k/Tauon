# Contributing to Tauon Music Box

Wanna contribute? Theres a few ways you can:

### Issues

If you encounter an issue, feel free to create new issues on github.

For crashes, it would be most helpful if you could replicate the crash and capture the error from terminal output.

  > To run manually for standard install: `python3 /opt/tauon-music-box/tauon.py`. 
  > Or for Flatpak: `flatpak run com.github.taiko2k.tauonmb`

For suggestions, I may or may not choose to implement certain things. Explaining how a feature would be integrated would be more helpful than vague ideas.
Design concepts would be interesting to see, but you should check with me before investing too much time into it.

### Code Contributions

The current code base is very (very) messy, as such I don't expect code contributions. 

### Other

Other areas for contribution could include website design, UI concepts, icon design, promotion and documentation.
